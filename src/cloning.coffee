  # private

  # Clones a resource recursively, taking in a cloner argument to protect against circular cloning
  #   of relationships
  #
  # @note This will clone:
  #   1. Resource errors
  #   2. Resource links
  #   3. Resource queryParams
  #   4. Resource attributes
  #   5. Resource relationships
  #     a. Relationship links
  #     b. Relationship loaded status
  #     c. Relationship resources, according to these principles:
  #       1. An autosave association is interpreted as part of the identity of a resource. If the resource
  #          is cloned, the autosave association target is cloned, and vice-versa.
  #       2. Only clone a related resource if it is part of the identity of the resource being cloned.
  #
  # @option [ActiveResource::Base] cloner the resource cloning this resource (always a related resource)
  # @option [Integer] nestedIndex cloning initiated directly from uncloned cloner, use index to replace clone on cloner relationship
  # @option [ActiveResource::Base] newCloner the clone of cloner to reassign fields to
  # @return [ActiveResource::Base] the cloned resource
